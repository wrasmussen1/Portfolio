For this project I used Python Jupyter Notebook and an API from collegefootballdata.com and pulled in games from the last 5 seasons of college football. Using this data I created an Elo based ranking system that would allow me to determine the relative strength of a team based on results of the games. From that I built out multiple models that predicted different the margin and outcome of the games. This used a variety of different models including regressions and classifier models.

I created this project as part of my Bellevue University Masterâ€™s of Data Science degree. This project was completed on March 13, 2022.
