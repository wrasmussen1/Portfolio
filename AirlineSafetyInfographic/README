For this project I used Tableau to create a infographic for airline safety. I was tasked with creating this flyer as there is a misconception over the safety of air travel. This was created using Tableau and Figma to build a flyer that could get the point across to airline travelers.

I created this project as part of my Bellevue University Master's of Data Science degree. This project was completed on March 4th, 2021.
