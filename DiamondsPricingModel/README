For this project I used Python Jupyter Notebook to create a model that could help price diamonds based on the different features. I created a model that used price as the target variable and split the data into a training and testing set to verify accuracy and the success of the model. It included cleaning of data, building a model, and visualizations.Â 

I created this project as part of my Bellevue University Master's of Data Science degree. This project was completed on November 19th, 2021.
